This NFT program is built on Anchor framework and has 3 main functions: mint, transfer and burn. NFTs minted in this program can't hold metadata for now.
Program is congiguired for localnet (Anchor.toml).

Building guide:
1. Acnhor must be installed for the program to work;
2. Change wallet atribute in Anchor.toml to the path to your local keypair;
3. For building the program run "anchor build" in the cli;
4. For running and testing the program run "anchor test" in the cli;
5. For deploying the program run "anchor deploy" (solana-test-validator must be running and your local keypair must have funds);
6. final_project.idl will be created after deploying that can be used in frontend apps.
